# Books projects
This is a repository to finally make ideas into action, namely emulating all the LM, DL, ML, NLP books that I have.
Each directory consists of one book specifically with the code for the book contained in subdirs. 

## The Hundred page Language Models Book (Andriy Burkov)
The directory `hundred_page_lm_book` contains all the code from the book ordered in Chapters.
